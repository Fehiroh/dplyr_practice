# Instructions

In order to help you start using the information outlined during my presentation, I've made two sets of questions for you to answer. In order to work on these questions, click the folder in this repository with the corresponding name, and download the "name_question.R" file. 
If you get stuck or want to check your work, the answers to each group of questions can be found in the same folder. ie. iris_answers.R will be beside iris_questions.R within the iris folder. 

# About the Data Sets

## Iris

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
